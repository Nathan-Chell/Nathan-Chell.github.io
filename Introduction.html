								<h1>Introduction</h1>
								<p>Many museum and public displays of dinosaurs are either real skeletal recreations based on recovered fossils found in
								stone, with casts being made from them or public attraction pieces that are made of hard plastic required by their kid
								friendly and outdoor placement (Tyrannosaurus rex, OnlyDinosaurs)</p>

								<p>This model prototype provides a
								different perspective of a T-Rex skull intending to combine both the skeletal structure and a skin imitation of a real
								T-Rex. With this model intending to be a hands off, display model various child-friendly concerns wont have to be the
								top priority during the design and development phases.</p>

								<h1>Model Aims</h1>
								<p>This model needed to be visually appealing, with a good blend of a realistic representation of a T-Rex skull’s bone
								structure combined with an outer skin design that represents the creature’s flesh. In addition, the lower jaw should
								move allowing for it to be opened and closed on a bearing joint inside the skull, this joint needed to be a fluid motion
								that’s strong enough to hold the jaws weight. This model should also be safe and durable enough to be in an enclosed
								display environment for extended periods of time, while also being able to survive accidental contact. Notably this
								model is designed for indoor artificially lit rooms.</p>

							<div class="Constraints">
								<h1>Design Constraints</h1>
								<li>The model needed to be lightweight and easy to handle in order for easy relocation inside a display environment, as well
								as aiding in reduced jaw bearing complexity as a light jaw subjects the bearing to less force.</li>
								<li>The material costs had to be considered as this model was developed under a budget.</li>
								<li>Design fabrication time and environmental effects were also considerations that had to be taken into account, as this
								model aims to be as least environmentally damaging as possible. Material choice prioritized biodegradability and minimal
								harmful fumes during production, leading to the selection of PLA filament (Boissonneault, 2023; Bluhm, 2022).</li>
