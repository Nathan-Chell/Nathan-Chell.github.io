								<h1>Design</h1>
								<p>The design phase focused on translating the goals of the project into a tangible, working solution. The availability of
								3D modelling software such as Autodesk’s Fusion 360 was a critical tool that was used during this phase of development.
								It facilitated the rapid modelling of various aspects of the model, including a 3D printable bearing for the jaw
								mechanism, and spring mounts to ensure smooth jaw movement.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="Design">
								<h1>Jaw Bearing</h1>
								<h2>Justification</h2>
								<p>For the jaw movement a bearing, situated at the connection point between the lower and upper jaw segments, was to be
								used. The decision to design and 3D print a bearing was made fairly quickly, this was down to the cost of procuring two
								ball bearings from a retailer being too high, with one unit costing in excess of £21 (RS, 2024). Designing and printing
								a print-in-place substitute was much cheaper and was ultimately the path that was taken.</p>
								<h2>Design considerations</h2>
								<p>Whilst a usual bearing surrounds balls in walls to contain them, this was deemed as unnecessary and potentially worse as
								3D printing perfectly spherical balls can be a challenge, owing to the extreme overhangs at the tops and bottoms of them
								as they are being printed. To reduce wasted prints, rollers which increased in diameter at the ends were used instead.
								This allowed the “ball” substitutes, rollers, to roll while not falling out, similar to a train wheel design. 
								Whilst the negative was used to form the centre and outer casing. </p>

								<h2>Design challenges</h2>
								<p>The initial concept for the bearing incorporated 45-degree chamfered edges. However, limitations with 3D printers not
								being able to print excessive overhangs (Kondo, 2023) necessitated a redesign for improved printability. The bearing was
								redesigned with a 60-degree cut-out leaving a 30-degree chamfered edge allowing the overhangs to be printed correctly,
								in place without any supports which would result in wasted materials and energy.</p>
								<h2>Material choice and trade-offs</h2>
								<p>Polylactic Acid (PLA), a common and easy to work with filament was chosen as the material for the model to be made of.
								With the model intending to be used as a display piece, extreme durability and strength wasn’t required. PLA is a strong
								enough material to support its own weight while being transported or touched, if the model was prone to being dropped an
								alternative material such as ABS would be a better choice (TWI, 2020).
								
								Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), results in visible layer lines affecting the surface smoothness of the model. For an
								initial prototype that doesn’t require perfect operability, a layer height of 0.2mm was used. This leads to obvious
								lines in the print that will affect the roughness of the inner bearing and the rollers. However, 0.2mm was chosen to
								save on material cost and printing time, a final bearing could be printed with layer heights all the way down to 0.08mm
								to increase smoothness.
								
								Moreover, PLA is a bioplastic being commonly made of fermented plant starch (BioPak, 2024) which can be recycled to
								create new filament or composted into carbon dioxide and water in less than 90 days in a controlled environment (How
								sustainable is PLA 3D printer filament?, Kinworthy, 2024). All while emitting fewer harmful fumes during the printing
								process than alternative materials like ABS (Xometry, 2023). This led to its selection for use in all prototype models.</p>
								<h2>Initial Design</h2>
								<p>As stated above, the initial design of the bearing involved 45-degree chamfered edges, however this was determined to be
								unsuitable for 3d printing. Therefore, the bearing was redesigned to only allow a maximum of a 30-degree overhang, which
								results in better printing performance. The inner roller was designed first:</p>
								<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/nathan-chell/Nathan-Chell.github.io/main/assets/stls/Jaw_Bearing/Inner_Bearing_60_1.stl"></script>
								<p>Only one half was designed as the bearing will be symmetrical about the z-axis. The inner-smaller section was designed
								to be half the size of the chamfered section. This design was incorporated into the main body that included an inner
								circle and outer-ring that were extruded up to 20mm and then given a chamfered edge of 30 degrees.</p>

								<p>This resulted in the final design of:</p>
								<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/nathan-chell/Nathan-Chell.github.io/main/assets/stls/Jaw_Bearing/Bearing_2_60_degree_5_Complete.stl"></script>
								<p>This bearing prioritises both maintainability and functionality, it is intended to be press fit into a cutout inside the
								skull of the model. This will allow for the ability to swap out the bearing if it breaks without needing to replace the
								entire model, while still ensuring the structural rigidity needed for a static display piece. The jaw component of the
								model will feature a hexagonal shaft designed to interface with the bearing’s internal bore. This provides excellent
								grip ensuring the jaw doesn’t slip when trying to be moved. The shaft is as follows:</p>

								<p>A 3D scan of a T-Rex was the initial plan for the main body of the model. 3D scanning allows the capture of physical
								objects into highly detailed digital, three-dimensional models (Rankin, 2023). This process involves projecting lasers
								or structured light patterns onto an object’s surface while cameras capture how the light distorts. Specialized software
								then analyses these distortions to extrapolate thousands of points in space, forming a point cloud that meticulously
								describes the object's form (Explaining the 3D scanning process: How it works 2023). 3D scanning is ideal for complex
								surfaces or objects that require massive amounts of data for accurate representation. It eliminates the guesswork of
								traditional modelling methods and can be far more practical than using a touch probe (What is 3D scanning? 2016). 3D
								scanning has widespread applications, from reverse engineering and product design to medical modelling, historical
								preservation, and even quality control in manufacturing (Best uses of 3D scanning and its applications).
								
								A handheld 3D scanner was to be used in-order to generate an accurate digital version of a T-Rex’s skull, however a
								model representation of a T-Rex’s skull couldn’t be sourced in time for this projects completion, therefore an existing
								digital representation was to be sourced and used. Two 3D scans of real T-Rex skulls were identified and collected as
								reference material (Tyrannosaurus Rex (NHMW-Geo 1998Z0049/0001) - 3D model by Natural History Museum vienna (@NHMWien);
								T- Rex Skull - Download Free 3D model by Laser Design (@laserdesign)). These were used as reference in order to modify a
								preexisting 3D printable T-Rex model (Thingiverse, 2014). It was determined that the skull and jaw should be more
								pronounced and defined than in the original, in addition a complete redesign of the teeth were desired.
								
								To add additional detail onto the skull and jaw of the T-Rex, a haptic modelling pen was used to add additional contours
								and recessed areas to the model. A haptic modelling pen is a motorised device that applies force feedback to a user, in
								accordance to a digital model. This allows a user to ‘feel’ the model as they manipulate it. Haptic touch pens are
								intended for use in simulation, skills assessment, virtual assembly, robotic control, collision detection, machine
								interface design and mapping (3D systems, 2023). For this project, the haptic pen was used to sculpt the original model
								into an improved, higher-detail design based on the reference material. The ability to feel the model and 'pop into it'
								using the pen allowed for a quick turnaround when modifying the model. The force feedback provided a more intuitive
								sculpting experience compared to traditional digital tools such as Blender, allowing for rapid iteration and ultimately
								resulting in a superior model.</p>
