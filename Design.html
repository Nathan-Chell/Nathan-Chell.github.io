								<h1>Design</h1>
								<p>The design phase focused on translating the goals of the project into a tangible, working solution. The availability of
								3D modelling software such as Autodesk’s Fusion 360 was a critical tool that was used during this phase of development.
								It facilitated the rapid modelling of various aspects of the model, including a 3D printable bearing for the jaw
								mechanism, and spring mounts to ensure smooth jaw movement.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="Design">
								<h1>Jaw Bearing</h1>
								<h2>Justification</h2>
								<p>For the jaw movement a bearing, situated at the connection point between the lower and upper jaw segments, was to be
								used. The decision to design and 3D print a bearing was made fairly quickly, this was down to the cost of procuring two
								ball bearings from a retailer being too high, with one unit costing in excess of £21 (RS, 2024). Designing and printing
								a print-in-place substitute was much cheaper and was ultimately the path that was taken.</p>
								<h2>Design considerations</h2>
								<p>Whilst a usual bearing surrounds balls in walls to contain them, this was deemed as unnecessary and potentially worse as
								3D printing perfectly spherical balls can be a challenge, owing to the extreme overhangs at the tops and bottoms of them
								as they are being printed. To reduce wasted prints, rollers which increased in diameter at the ends were used instead.
								This allowed the “ball” substitutes, rollers, to roll while not falling out, similar to a train wheel design. [IMAGE OF
								TRAIN WHEEL AND CROSS SECTION OF BEARING PIN]. Whilst the negative was used to form the centre and outer casing.</p>
								<h2>Design challenges</h2>
								<p>The initial concept for the bearing incorporated 45-degree chamfered edges. However, limitations with 3D printers not
								being able to print excessive overhangs (Kondo, 2023) necessitated a redesign for improved printability. The bearing was
								redesigned with a 60-degree cut-out leaving a 30-degree chamfered edge allowing the overhangs to be printed correctly,
								in place without any supports which would result in wasted materials and energy.</p>
								<h2>Material choice and trade-offs</h2>
								<p>Polylactic Acid (PLA), a common and easy to work with filament was chosen as the material for the model to be made of.
								With the model intending to be used as a display piece, extreme durability and strength wasn’t required. PLA is a strong
								enough material to support its own weight while being transported or touched, if the model was prone to being dropped an
								alternative material such as ABS would be a better choice (TWI, 2020).
								
								Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), results in visible layer lines affecting the surface smoothness of the model. For an
								initial prototype that doesn’t require perfect operability, a layer height of 0.2mm was used. This leads to obvious
								lines in the print that will affect the roughness of the inner bearing and the rollers. However, 0.2mm was chosen to
								save on material cost and printing time, a final bearing could be printed with layer heights all the way down to 0.08mm
								to increase smoothness.
								
								Moreover, PLA is a bioplastic being commonly made of fermented plant starch (BioPak, 2024) which can be recycled to
								create new filament or composted into carbon dioxide and water in less than 90 days in a controlled environment (How
								sustainable is PLA 3D printer filament?, Kinworthy, 2024). All while emitting fewer harmful fumes during the printing
								process than alternative materials like ABS (Xometry, 2023). This led to its selection for use in all prototype models.</p>
