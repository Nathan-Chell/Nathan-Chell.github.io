								<h1>Design</h1>
								<p>The design phase focused on translating the goals of the project into a tangible, working solution. The availability of
								3D modelling software such as Autodesk’s Fusion 360 was a critical tool that was used during this phase of development.
								It facilitated the rapid modelling of various aspects of the model, including a 3D printable bearing for the jaw
								mechanism.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="Design">
								<h1>Jaw Bearing</h1>
								<h2>Justification</h2>
								<p>For the jaw movement a bearing, situated at the connection point between the lower and upper jaw segments, was to be
								used. The decision to design and 3D print a print-in-place bearing was made fairly quickly, this was down to the cost of procuring two
								ball bearings from a retailer being too high, with one unit costing in excess of £21 (RS, 2024). Designing and printing
								a print-in-place substitute was much cheaper and was ultimately the path that was taken.</p>
								<h2>Design considerations</h2>
								<p>Whilst a usual bearing surrounds balls in walls to contain them, this was deemed as unnecessary and potentially worse as
								3D printing perfectly spherical balls can be a challenge, owing to the extreme overhangs at the tops and bottoms of them
								as they are being printed. To reduce wasted prints, rollers which increased in diameter at the ends were used instead.
								This allowed the “ball” substitutes, rollers, to roll while not falling out, similar to a train wheel design. 
								Whilst the negative was used to form the centre and outer casing. </p>

									</figure>
								</span>
								<h2>Design challenges</h2>
								<p>The initial concept for the bearing incorporated 45-degree chamfered edges. However, limitations with 3D printers not
								being able to print excessive overhangs (Kondo, 2023) necessitated a redesign for improved printability. The bearing was
								redesigned with a 60-degree cut-out leaving a 30-degree chamfered edge allowing the overhangs to be printed correctly,
								in place without any supports which would result in wasted materials and energy.</p>
								<h2>Material choice and trade-offs</h2>
								<p>Polylactic Acid (PLA), a common and easy to work with filament was chosen as the material for the model to be made of.
								With the model intending to be used as a display piece, extreme durability and strength wasn’t required. PLA is a strong
								enough material to support its own weight while being transported or touched, if the model was prone to being dropped an
								alternative material such as ABS would be a better choice (TWI, 2020).
								
								Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), results in visible layer lines affecting the surface smoothness of the model. For an
								initial prototype that doesn’t require perfect operability, a layer height of 0.2mm was used. This leads to obvious
								lines in the print that will affect the roughness of the inner bearing and the rollers. However, 0.2mm was chosen to
								save on material cost and printing time, a final bearing could be printed with layer heights all the way down to 0.08mm
								to increase smoothness.
								
								Moreover, PLA is a bioplastic being commonly made of fermented plant starch (BioPak, 2024) which can be recycled to
								create new filament or composted into carbon dioxide and water in less than 90 days in a controlled environment (How
								sustainable is PLA 3D printer filament?, Kinworthy, 2024). All while emitting fewer harmful fumes during the printing
								process than alternative materials like ABS (Xometry, 2023). This led to its selection for use in all prototype models.</p>
								<h2>Initial Design</h2>
								<p>The design of the bearing was created using Autodesk’s Fusion 360, its parameter focused design capabilities allowed for
								precise control of every section of the model. The precise extrude mode allowed for accurate control of dimensions. In
								addition, fusion 360’s circular pattern feature allowed for easy duplication of the rollers in a symmetrical pattern.</p>
								<p>As stated above, the initial design of the bearing involved 45-degree chamfered edges, however this was determined to be
								unsuitable for 3d printing. Therefore, the bearing was redesigned to only allow a maximum of a 30-degree overhang, which
								results in better printing performance. The inner roller was designed first:</p>
								<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/nathan-chell/Nathan-Chell.github.io/main/assets/stls/Jaw_Bearing/Inner_Bearing_60_1.stl"></script>
								<p>Only one half was designed as the bearing will be symmetrical about the z-axis. The inner-smaller section was designed
								to be half the size of the chamfered section. This design was incorporated into the main body that included an inner
								circle and outer-ring that were extruded up to 20mm and then given a chamfered edge of 30 degrees.</p>

									<source src="assets/videos/Main_design.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<p>This resulted in the final design of:</p>
								<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/nathan-chell/Nathan-Chell.github.io/main/assets/stls/Jaw_Bearing/Bearing_2_60_degree_5_Complete.stl"></script>
								<p>This bearing prioritises both maintainability and functionality, it is intended to be press fit into a cutout inside the
								skull of the model. This will allow for the ability to swap out the bearing if it breaks without needing to replace the
								entire model, while still ensuring the structural rigidity needed for a static display piece. The jaw component of the
								model will feature a hexagonal shaft designed to interface with the bearing’s internal bore. This provides excellent
								grip ensuring the jaw doesn’t slip when trying to be moved. The shaft is as follows:</p>
								<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/3d/Nathan-Chell/Nathan-Chell.github.io/main/assets/stls/Jaw_Bearing/Shaft_1.stl"></script>
								<p>A 3D scan of a T-Rex was the initial plan for the main body of the model. 3D scanning allows for the capture of physical
								objects into highly detailed digital, three-dimensional models (Rankin, 2023). This process involves projecting lasers
								or structured light patterns onto an object’s surface while cameras capture how the light distorts. Specialised software
								then analyses these distortions to extrapolate thousands of points in space, forming a point cloud that meticulously
								describes the object's form (Explaining the 3D scanning process: How it works 2023). 3D scanning is ideal for complex
								surfaces or objects that require massive amounts of data for accurate representation. It eliminates the guesswork of
								traditional modelling methods and can be far more practical than using a touch probe (What is 3D scanning? 2016). 3D
								scanning has widespread applications, from reverse engineering and product design to medical modelling, historical
								preservation, and even quality control in manufacturing (Best uses of 3D scanning and its applications).</p>
								
								<p>A handheld 3D scanner was to be used in-order to generate an accurate digital version of a T-Rex’s skull, however a
								model representation of a T-Rex’s skull couldn’t be sourced in time for this projects completion, therefore an existing
								digital representation was to be sourced and used. Two 3D scans of real T-Rex skulls were identified and collected as
								reference material (Tyrannosaurus Rex (NHMW-Geo 1998Z0049/0001) - 3D model by Natural History Museum vienna (@NHMWien);
								T- Rex Skull - Download Free 3D model by Laser Design (@laserdesign)). These were used as reference in order to modify a
								preexisting 3D printable T-Rex model (Thingiverse, 2014). It was determined that the skull and jaw should be more
								pronounced and defined than in the original, in addition a complete redesign of the teeth was desired.</p>
								
								<p>To add additional detail onto the skull and jaw of the T-Rex, a haptic modelling pen was used to add additional contours
								and recessed areas to the model. A haptic modelling pen is a motorised device that applies force feedback to a user, in
								accordance to a digital model. This allows a user to ‘feel’ the model as they manipulate it. Haptic touch pens are
								intended for use in simulation, skills assessment, virtual assembly, robotic control, collision detection, machine
								interface design and mapping (3D systems, 2023). For this project, the haptic pen was used to sculpt the original model
								into an improved, higher-detailed design based on the reference material. The ability to feel the model and 'pop into it'
								using the pen allowed for a quick turnaround when modifying the model. The force feedback provided a more intuitive
								sculpting experience compared to traditional digital tools such as Blender, allowing for rapid iteration and ultimately
								resulting in a superior model.</p>

								<h4>For best comparison results use 'Surface Angle' as the viewing method</h4>
								<p>Blender, a powerful 3D modelling application, was used to design the individual teeth and was used to generate a full
								set that can be replaced on the T-Rex model. A basic cone shape was extruded and deformed to achieve the required shape.
								Subtle variations were created to ensure a unique looking set. Blender’s array modifier was employed to create multiple
								instances of the tooth. These were positioned, scaled, and rotated into the desired place in-order to create a full set
								(Blender, About; Blender, Modeling).</p>
								<p>Blender’s versatility and accessible nature make it an extremely popular tool across various industry sectors. Studios
								often use blender for modelling, animation and effects in films and television. In addition, Blender is extensively used
								to create 3D game assets and environments. Blender has the ability to directly export model creations into stl files,
								allowing for the quick printing of any model created (Chillingworth, 2024).</p>
								<p>However, Blender has a steep learning curve due to its vast feature set. Complex renders and simulations can be
								extremely hardware intensive, requiring power machine to operate efficiently. Moreover, it doesn’t contain the precision
								tools needed for highly accurate technical modelling that would be required to create a bearing for example
								(Southernshotty & Hassenfranz, 2023). It was for these reasons that Blender was only used to create the teeth, which
								were more artistic than technical.</p>
								<h3>The set of teeth that was created using blender</h3>

								<p>Resins have become ubiquitous across various industry sectors due to their impressive versatility. In the automotive
								sectors, resins are crucial for creating lightweight, high-strength components like body panels. They offer excellent
								durability and design flexibility compared to traditional methods (Insights, 2023; Polymers, Automotive). Meanwhile,
								specialised materials like silicone rubber can be used to create realistic-looking skin for applications like
								prosthetics, special effects, or even animal models such as this projects T-Rex. Its flexibility allows it to conform to
								irregular surfaces and provides a paintable surface for a customised aesthetic. However, silicone-based skin solutions
								can be expensive and challenging to work with, resulting in potential defects. Additionally, silicone rubber often has
								lower tear resistance, requiring careful handling to ensure longevity.</p>
								<h2>Challenges</h2>
								<p>A significant challenge arose when attempting to convert the highly detailed T-Rex model, particularly the skull and jaw
								sections, into a parametric model within Fusion 360. Fusion 360 relies on parametric modelling to ensure precise
								dimensions and allow for easy modifications (McGarry, 2023). However, highly detailed models, especially those derived
								from sculpting, often consist of irregular mesh structures. Translating these complex meshes into a format that Fusion
								360 can manipulate requires substantial computational power. In this case, the sheer number of polygons in the T-Rex
								model overwhelmed Fusion 360's conversion tools. This process proved excessively time-consuming and ultimately
								impractical for the project's scope. As a result, features like the bearing shaft, the negative space it requires, and
								the set of teeth couldn't be directly modelled onto the jaw and skull.</p>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>The design process of this T-Rex model successfully demonstrated the power of combining various digital tools and
								fabrication methods. This project demonstrated the adaptability of design workflows in response to challenges, such as
								the unavailability of a physical T-Rex skull for scanning. By sourcing an existing 3D model and utilising a haptic pen
								for detailed modifications, a realistic and unique representation of the T-Rex skull was achieved.</p>
								
								<p>A comparison of 3D printing materials was conducted, and as a result PLA was chosen as the material of choice that the
								models will be made of. PLA’s biodegradability made it a responsible choice for rapid prototyping. Fusion 360 and
								Blender was used to create various models that would come together to create a final model.</p>
