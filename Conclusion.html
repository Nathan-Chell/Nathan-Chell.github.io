								<h1>Conclusion</h1>
								<p>The design and development phases of this project successfully showcased the power of combining digital design tools
								like Fusion 360 and Blender with 3D printing technology to create a functional model. The project demonstrated the
								ability to adapt designs based on challenges, such as the inability to 3D scan a physical T-Rex model. The use of a
								haptic pen allowed for rapid adaption of a pre-existing 3D model to create a unique version of the model. The prototype
								models were printed in PLA due to its combination of strength, easy printing, cheap nature and biodegradability.</p>
								<h2>Future Work</h2>
								<p>If this project were to continue various additions would be made:</p>
								<p>A design for a base plate would be constructed and made out of laser cut acrylic, with an embossed name plate. Laser
								cutters can be used to create lightweight components with intricate details, it can also be used to engrave words or
								additional details onto models. However, acrylic isn’t the strongest material as it can be snapped easier than other
								materials, moreover, laser cutting can produce some very harmful fumes (Velling, 2024).</p>
								<p>Motion capture could be used to animate the T-Rex model, replicating realistic movements. This would create a dynamic
								and interactive experience, allowing viewers to observe lifelike T-Rex behaviour. However, challenges in integrating
								servo motors and processing large amounts of motion data would need to be addressed (FrouzaanFar, 2023).</p>
